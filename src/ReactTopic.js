    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <li>React is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly <b>single-page applications</b> where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, along with a community of individual developers and companies.</li>
    <li>React revolves around the concept of componentsâ€”independent, reusable pieces of the user interface. Each component can manage its own state and render itself based on that state. This modular approach makes it easy to build and maintain complex UIs.</li>
    <li><b>Performance: </b>React's virtual DOM and efficient update mechanism ensure high performance, even in complex applications.</li>
<li><b>Reusability:</b> Components can be reused across different parts of an application, promoting code reuse and maintainability.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility: </b>React can be used for various applications, from simple websites to complex enterprise-level applications.</li>
<li><b>Community and Support: </b>A large and active community means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries are available.</li>

</ul>

    <h2>React JSX</h2>
    <li>JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize the structure of the user interface.</li>
    <li>JSX looks similar to HTML, which makes it easy to understand and use for those familiar with HTML. It allows you to write HTML tags directly within JavaScript code.</li>
    <li>JSX is a powerful feature of React that enhances the development process by allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It simplifies the creation of dynamic and interactive UIs, making React development more efficient and enjoyable.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
    <h2>Component</h2>
    <li>In React, a component is a self-contained, reusable piece of the user interface. Components can be thought of as the building blocks of a React application, each responsible for rendering a part of the UI and managing its own logic and state.</li>
    <li><b>Reusability:</b>Components can be reused across different parts of an application, making the code more modular and maintainable.</li>
    <li><b>Composability:</b>Components can be composed together to build complex UIs. A parent component can contain child components, which can themselves contain other child components.</li>
    <li><b>Components are the fundamental building blocks of React applications. They encapsulate UI and logic into reusable, independent pieces that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. Whether using functional components with hooks or class components with lifecycle methods, React provides a flexible and powerful way to develop modern web applications.</b></li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
    <h2>State</h2>
    <li>In React, state is a built-in object that is used to store data or information about the component that can change over time. When the state of a component changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state, ensuring that the UI stays in sync with the data.</li>
    <li><b>Initialization:</b>State can be initialized in the constructor of a class component or directly within a functional component using hooks.</li>
    <li>State is a crucial concept in React that allows components to manage and respond to changing data. Whether using class components or functional components with hooks, understanding how to effectively manage state is key to building dynamic and responsive React applications.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <li>Data sharing in React involves passing data between components to maintain a consistent and synchronized state across your application. There are several techniques to achieve this, each suitable for different scenarios.</li>
    <li><b>Props:</b><br></br>
    <ul>
        <li>Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This is the most common and straightforward way to share data in React.</li>
        <li>// Parent Component<br></br>
function Parent() &#123;<br></br>
  const message = "Hello from Parent";<br></br>
  <br></br>
  return &lt;Child message=&#123;message&#125; /&gt;;<br></br>
  &#125;<br></br>
  <br></br>
// Child Component<br></br>
function Child(props) &#123;<br></br>
  return &lt;h1&gt;&#123;props.message&#125;&lt;/h1&gt;;<br></br>
  &#125;<br></br>
</li>
    </ul>

    </li>
    <li><b> Context API:</b>The Context API is used for more complex state sharing scenarios, such as global state management across many components, without prop drilling (passing props through many levels).</li>
    <li>Choosing the right method for data sharing in React depends on the complexity and size of your application. For simple scenarios, props and lifting state up are effective. For more complex state management, the Context API or Redux can be more appropriate. Each method has its use cases and understanding these will help you manage state and data flow efficiently in your React applications.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
    <h2>Hooks</h2>
    <li>Hooks are a feature in React that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become the standard way to manage state and side effects in functional components.</li>
    <li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>useState:</b><br></br>useState is a Hook that lets you add state to functional components. You pass the initial state to this function, and it returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.<br></br>
            import React, &#123; useState &#125; from 'react';<br></br>
            <br></br>
function Counter() &#123;<br></br>
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);<br></br>
  <br></br>
  return (<br></br>
    &lt;div&gt;<br></br>
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked &#123;count&#125;times&lt;/p&gt;<br></br>
      &ltbutton onClick=&#123;() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)&#125;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;<br></br>
    &lt;/div&gt;<br></br>
  );<br></br>
  &#125;<br></br>
</li>
<li>
    <b>useContext:</b>useContext is a Hook that lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    import React, &#123; useContext &#125; from 'react'; <br></br>
    <br></br>
const MyContext = React.createContext(); <br></br>
<br></br>
function MyComponent() &#123; <br></br>
  const value = useContext(MyContext); <br></br>
  return &lt;div&gt;&#123;value&#125;&lt;/div&gt;; <br></br>
  &#125; <br></br>
  <br></br>
function App() &#123; <br></br>
  return ( <br></br>
    &lt;MyContext.Provider value="Hello, World!"&gt; <br></br>
      &lt;MyComponent /&gt; <br></br>
    &lt;/MyContext.Provider&gt; <br></br>
  ); <br></br>
  &#125; <br></br>

</li>
<li>
    <b>useReducer:</b>useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.<br></br>
    import React, &#123; useReducer &#125; from 'react';<br></br>
    <br></br>
const initialState = &#123; count: 0&#125;;<br></br>
<br></br>
function reducer(state, action) &#123;<br></br>
  switch (action.type) &#123;<br></br>
    case 'increment':<br></br>
      return &#123; count: state.count + 1&#125;;<br></br>
    case 'decrement':<br></br>
      return &#123; count: state.count - 1 &#125;;<br></br>
    default:<br></br>
      throw new Error();<br></br>
      &#125;<br></br>
      &#125;<br></br>
      <br></br>
function Counter() &#123;<br></br>
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);<br></br>
  return (<br></br>
    &lt;div&gt;<br></br>
      &lt;p&gt;Count: &#123;state.count&#125; &lt;/p&gt;<br></br>
      &lt;button onClick=&#123;() =&gt; dispatch(&#123; type: 'increment' &#125;)&#125;&gt;+ &lt;/button&gt;<br></br>
      &lt;button onClick=&#123;() =&gt; dispatch(&#123; type: 'decrement'&#125;)&#125;&gt;- &lt;/button&gt;<br></br>
      &lt;/div&gt;<br></br>
  );<br></br>
  &#125;<br></br>

</li>
<li><b>useRef:</b>useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
<br></br>
import React, &#123; useRef, useEffect &#125; from 'react';<br></br>
<br></br>
function FocusableInput() &#123;<br></br>
  const inputRef = useRef(null);<br></br>
  <br></br>
  useEffect(() =&gt; &#123;<br></br>
    inputRef.current.focus();<br></br>
    &#125; , []);<br></br>
    <br></br>
  return &lt;input ref=&#123;inputRef&#125; /&gt;;<br></br>
  &#125; <br></br>
</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to use state and side effects in functional components. They make it easier to share and reuse logic between components without the need for HOCs (Higher Order Components) or render props, simplifying the component structure and improving readability. Understanding and effectively using hooks is essential for modern React development.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <h2>Class Component</h2>
  <li>Class components in React are one of the ways to define components, especially before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8. They allow you to utilize additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods</li>
  <li>A class component is defined using a JavaScript class that extends React.Component. It must contain a render() method, which returns the JSX to be rendered.</li>
  <li><b>State in Class Components</b>Class components can have a state, which is a built-in object used to store property values that belong to the component. The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.</li>
  <li><b>Lifecycle Methods:</b>
  <br></br>componentDidMount: Invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here.<br></br>

componentDidUpdate: Invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render.<br></br>

componentWillUnmount: Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers or cleaning up any DOM elements.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <h2>Function Component</h2>
  <li>Functional components in React are simpler and more concise compared to class components. They are essentially JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return JSX. With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now also manage state and lifecycle events, which were previously only possible in class components.</li>
  <li>Functional components in React provide a simpler and more concise way to create components compared to class components. With the addition of hooks, functional components can manage state, handle side effects, and encapsulate reusable logic. This has led to a shift towards using functional components as the standard for building React applications.</li>
</ul>
<hr></hr>
<ul>
  <h2>Redux</h2>
  <li>Redux is a popular state management library used with React to manage the state of the application in a predictable way. It is particularly useful for larger applications where managing state across multiple components can become complex. Redux follows a few key principles:</li>
  <li>Single Source of Truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.<br></br>
State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.<br></br>
Changes are Made with Pure Functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.</li>
<li><b>Setting Up Redux:</b>To use Redux with React, you typically use the react-redux library, which provides bindings for React.</li>
<li><b>npm install redux react-redux</b></li>
<li>Store: Holds the state of your application.<br></br>
Actions: Describe changes in the application state.<br></br>
Reducers: Handle actions and update the state accordingly.<br></br>
Provider: Makes the Redux store available to your React application.<br></br>
useSelector: Accesses the Redux state in your components.<br></br>
useDispatch: Dispatches actions from your components.</li>
</ul>
